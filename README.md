# prime
## Prime is a library that works with prime numbers
- to check if a number is prime
- to get the prime factor of a number

### Essential problems
- Listing out primes less than a specified number
- Determining whether a given number is prime
- Breaking a number into its prime factors

### Issues
- it works with integers within the bound of 10000

### Description
prime takes an optional command line parameter of "-f", which determines the operation type. If "-f" then, it prompts you for an input and returns
it prime factor(s), for any other parameter aside from "-f" prime will perform a primality check on user input, returning "It is prime!" if test is passed, otherwise "It is not a prime number".
